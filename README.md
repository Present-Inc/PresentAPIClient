PresentAPIClient
================

The Present API Client

###Installation
PresentAPIClient uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and `git submodules` to manage dependencies.  
**This will become centralized with Carthage soon enough!**

0. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases)
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `carthage update`
3. Open the `.xcodeproj`
4. Link the frameworks in `Carthage.build` to the project
5. `import PresentAPIClient` wherever you need to use the framework
